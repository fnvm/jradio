During the build, the project expects the `ffplay` binary in:

- `src/main/resources/ffmpeg/`

You can either include the FFmpeg binaries for your operating system in the appropriate directory, or simply install FFmpeg on your system and make sure that `ffplay` is available in `PATH`.


To build the project:

```bash
mvn clean package
```
